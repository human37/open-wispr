# open-wispr

> Free, open-source voice dictation for macOS. Powered by Whisper AI, runs 100% on-device.

open-wispr is a lightweight macOS app that provides push-to-talk voice dictation. Hold a hotkey, speak, release — transcribed text appears at your cursor in any app. It uses OpenAI's Whisper model running locally via whisper.cpp, so no audio or text ever leaves the machine.

## Key Facts

- **Price**: Free and open source (MIT license)
- **Platform**: macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- **Privacy**: 100% on-device. Zero network requests. Audio is recorded to a temp file, transcribed locally, and immediately deleted.
- **Install**: `brew install human37/open-wispr/open-wispr` or guided installer via `curl -fsSL https://open-wispr.pages.dev/install.sh | bash`

## How It Works

1. Hold the Globe key (or a custom hotkey)
2. Speak naturally
3. Release — text is typed at your cursor via macOS Accessibility

- Multiple Whisper model sizes (tiny, base, small, medium, large)
- Configurable hotkey, language, and model via `~/.config/open-wispr/config.json`
